# Time Series LSTM Model for Microsoft Stock Prices

## Overview

This project is focused on creating a Time Series Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict Microsoft stock prices using PyTorch. The model is designed to capture the sequential dependencies in stock price data, enabling more accurate predictions.

## Motivation

This project was developed as part of the Microsoft Turkey FY 24 Summer Internship program. The goal was to apply machine learning techniques to real-world financial data, enhancing predictive capabilities in stock market analysis.

## Project Structure

- **MSFT.csv**: The dataset of Microsoft stock prices.
- **msft.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with the data exploration, model building, evaluation processes and training model.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huseyinbattal3469/microsoft_project_FY24
cd microsoft_project_FY24
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure that the stock price data is correctly placed in the `MSFT.csv`.
2. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Run the `msft.ipynb` script to build the LSTM model and evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. Detailed results and visualizations are available in the `microsoft_project_FY24/` directory.
